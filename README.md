# Airflow

Airflow is a C++ library for creating and managing thread-pools.

## API Reference

Airflow's API is documented in the code with Doxygen. The API reference can be generated by calling the Python script `tools/generate-docs`. This script also accepts an `--internal` flag to generate documentation for internal code that isn't user-facing.
